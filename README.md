# Simple Cookie Checker
Just a cookie checker for Roblox, does not require proxies and it's 100% safe.

### Dependencies
- [Node.js (tested on v16.15.1)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- npm (can be any other package manager like yarn but then you need to install it manually)

### Instalation
Just simply run file `install.bat` or if you want to do it manually go to `src` folder and run command:
```
npm i
```
### Usage
Using this is pretty simple as name says, just put your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie into `cookies.txt` file and run `start.txt`, alternatively you can run one of commands below from `src` folder:
```
node .
or
npm start
```
### Forks
If you want to fork it then there's no problems, i'll probably not gonna update it so often because it doesn't have so many functionalities that might break within time.
And if you think it's a virus then that's why it is on github, you can check code whenever you want!
